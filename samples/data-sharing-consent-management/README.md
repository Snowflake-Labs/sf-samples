## Data Sharing Consent Management

This directory contains the SQL files for a way of implementing consent management for data sharing on top of Snowflake. It also includes a Mock UI to show what the end consumer experience would be.

Before you get started, you will need:
1. Two Snowflake accounts in the same region.
2. The account IDs of these accounts.
3. The permissions needed to create warehouses, databases, and schemas for these accounts.

This is a version 1.0, and additional enhancements will come in the future.
