    "\n",
    "AISQL delivers an easy-to-use composable query language that handles both text and multimodal data through familiar SQL syntax. Our high-performance batch engine processes queries faster through intelligent query optimization, while delivering lower costs than traditional AI solutions. Natively ingest structured and unstructured data into unified multimodal tables, enabling comprehensive insights through familiar SQL analytics for all your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AI SQL Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Easy-to-use SQL syntax to build AI pipelines without complex coding\n",
    "2. High-performance processing across all modalities (text, image, audio)\n",
    "3. Lower cost batch processing through optimized architecture to support faster and larger batch jobs.\n",

    "AI-powered SQL operator for semantic filtering. You can use the same syntax on a single table (for filtering) or join multiple tables together upon a semantic relationship.

    "  \"text\": \"Good afternoon, Robert. Thanks for calling in today. I understand you had some concerns about your portfolio you wanted to discuss. Yes, I'm really worried. I've been watching the news and the market's been all over the place lately. I'm thinking maybe I should just sell everything, all my stocks and mutual funds and put it all in bonds or CDs. At least then I could sleep at night. I can definitely understand that concern, Robert. Market volatility can be unsettling, especially when you're seeing those daily swings in the headlines. Before we talk about any major moves, can you help me understand what specifically is driving this anxiety? Is it the recent tech sector pullback or something more general? It's everything. I'm 52 years old and I keep thinking about what happened in 2008. I lost so much then and I'm worried we're heading for another crash with this new administration. I can't afford to lose my retirement savings. Those are absolutely valid concerns, and I appreciate you sharing that context. That was a really challenging time for everyone. Let me ask you this. When we last reviewed your portfolio in March, we had you allocated at about 70% equities and 30% bonds, correct? And your target retirement age is still 62%. That's right. But honestly, 70% in stocks feels way too risky right now. I'm thinking more like 20% stocks, 80% bonds, maybe even less in stocks. I understand that instinct, Robert. Let's walk through this together. First, I want to remind you of something important. Your current portfolio is already designed with volatility in mind. You're not in individual stocks. You're in diversified index funds and some actively managed funds across different sectors and even international markets. But they're still going down. My quarterly statement showed I was down 8% this quarter alone. You're absolutely right, and that's painful to see, but let's put this in perspective. Over the past 12 months, even with this recent volatility, your portfolio is still up about 3%. The market has given back some gains, but we're not in crisis territory. Remember, we built your allocation specifically because you have 10 years until retirement. That time horizon is actually your biggest asset here. So you're saying I should just do nothing? Not exactly nothing, but I am suggesting we don't make dramatic changes based on short-term market movements. However, I do hear your concern about risk tolerance. What if we made a smaller adjustment? Instead of going to 20% stocks, what if we moved to 60% stocks and 40% bonds? That would reduce your equity exposure by 10%, which might help you sleep better, but wouldn't take you completely out of the growth potential you need for retirement. That actually sounds more reasonable, but I'm still worried about losing more money. I understand completely. Let me ask you this. What's your bigger worry, the volatility of the next year, two or two, or having enough money to retire comfortably at 62? Because if we get too conservative now, inflation alone could erode your purchasing power over the next decade. I didn't really thought about inflation that way. I guess I've been so focused on not losing money that I forgot about the money I might not make. Exactly. And remember, Robert, you're not alone in this. I've had this conversation with many clients over the past few weeks. The ones who stayed disciplined during previous market downturns are generally glad they did. What if we also set up a plan where we review your portfolio monthly for the next few months? That way you'll have regular check-ins and won't feel like you're just riding this out blindly. Monthly reviews would definitely help. And maybe the 60-40 split is a good compromise. I just, I don't want to be stupid about this. Robert, wanting to protect your retirement isn't stupid. It's exactly what you should be thinking about. The key is making sure we're protecting it in the right way. Staying invested in a diversified portfolio, even with some volatility, has historically been the best way to preserve and grow wealth over time. Okay, I think I can live with moving to 60% stocks, but if things get really bad... If things get really bad, we'll talk again. That's what I'm here for. And remember, we'll be reviewing this monthly anyway. You're not locked into anything forever. But I do want to emphasize that market timing is incredibly difficult, even for professionals. The goal isn't to avoid all volatility. It's to stay invested long enough to benefit from the market's long-term upward trend. All right, Sarah, let's do the rebalancing to 60-40 and I'll try to stop checking my account balance every day. It sounds like a solid plan, Robert. And yes, definitely limit the daily balance checking. That's a recipe for anxiety. I'll send you some research on historical market recoveries after our call and we'll schedule our first monthly review for next month. How does that sound? That sounds good. Thanks for talking me through this, Sarah. I feel a lot better than when I called. I'm so glad to hear that, Robert. Remember, staying invested requires patience, but your future self will thank you for it. I'll have the rebalancing done by tomorrow morning, and you should see the changes reflected in your account by Thursday. Perfect. Thanks again, Sarah. I thank you deeply for your patience and understanding. I'll talk to you next month.\"\n",

    "  - Returns information like file paths, sizes, and timestamps for all files in the stage\n",

    "##### 🔗 **File Data Type Creation**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generated File References**: Used [TO_FILE()](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/to_file) to create [FILE data types](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/data-types-unstructured#label-data-types-file)\n",

    "Used `TO_OBJECT(PARSE_JSON(...))` to create the [AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/ai_parse_document) `<options>` argument\n",
