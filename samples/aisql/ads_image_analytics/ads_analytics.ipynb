    "# Multi-Modal Advertisement Analytics using Snowflake Cortex AI SQL\n",
    "Effective advertisement campaign analysis requires understanding both structured data (impressions, clicks, metadata) and unstructured content (images, visual elements). In this notebook, you'll use Cortex AI SQL to systematically analyze advertisement images, extract insights, and optimize campaign performance through intelligent classification and content generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "This demonstrates how modern marketing analytics teams can leverage Snowflake's Cortex AI SQL to analyze multi-modal advertising data. The system processes advertisement images from campaigns, analyzes visual content using AI functions, classifies ad types, and generates insights to optimize future campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will leverage multiple AI SQL functions to build an intelligent advertisement analytics workflow that:\n",
    "- Filters advertisements based on specific visual criteria using **AI_FILTER**\n",
    "- Classifies advertisement types automatically with **AI_CLASSIFY**\n",
    "- Generates creative taglines and content using **AI_COMPLETE**\n",
    "- Aggregates customer feedback and sentiment analysis with **AI_AGG**\n",
    "- Processes image files using the new **FILE data type**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary business value is creating a more intelligent and scalable approach to advertisement campaign analysis that enables marketing teams to understand visual content performance, optimize creative assets, and make data-driven decisions about future campaigns.\n",
