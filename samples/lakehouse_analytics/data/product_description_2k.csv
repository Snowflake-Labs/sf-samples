0001053396,,Books,"Writing poetry has always been a way to express what is going on in the world around us. Unfortunately, sometimes what is around us is war. Acclaimed British actor Paul McGann reads poems that date from the eighteenth century to modern times in this moving audio anthology. McGann is originally from Liverpool, and he still retains a slight Northern accent. Its lilting cadence blends well with the rhythm and worldliness of these powerful poems. Although some of the pieces are well known, others are less so, and this makes the collection even more intriguing for lovers of literature.

0002007649,,Books,"Widely known in Canada from hisMontreal Gazettecolumn, and work with the Discovery Channel, Schwarcz (Let Them Eat Flax) is an entertaining guide through the tangle of conflicting research studies, advertising claims, special interest groups, age-old myths and popular opinion that make diet a cloudy subject. In short chapters he aims his microscope at such highly touted foods as tomatoes, acai berries, curry and soy; additives like nitrites, artificial sweeteners, vitamins and fluoride; contaminants including pesticides, hormones, trans fats and dioxins; and what, for him, are suspect fads. Schwarcz contends that while there are no magical foods, a diet of mostly vegetables, fruits, whole grains and low-fat dairy products and moderation are key to good health. To help readers make informed choices, he ably cuts through many controversies and will likely stir up a few (he challenges those who condemn milk consumption, espouse detoxification and promote kosher foods, for example). Schwarcz makes learning fun by peppering his text with fascinating facts (coffee contains naturally occurring carcinogens, and apples have formaldehyde). More importantly, he leaves readers with a rational framework for evaluating the complex nature of foods and how they affect health.(Jan.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

0002153238,,Books,"A glossy, predictable paean to American Jewry by the producers of the Day in the Life series, this oversize collection of photographs traverses the country, capturing cowboys and Soviet Jewry activists, magicians and roving rabbis. The belabored point here is that Jews have special customs--circumcision, bar mitzvah, Passover seder--that set them apart, but Jews are also as American as apple pie. Hence, many of the 197 pictures, most of them color, reiterate that Jews are just regular folk: there are cozy multigenerational shots and photos of Jewish doctors, astronauts, hikers, soldiers, prisoners, casket-makers, emotionally disturbed youth. Cohen, co-editor of Christmas in America , plays up a familiar ethnic focus on food and stardom (a photograph of Steven Spielberg and his mom, Leah Adler, who owns a kosher L.A. restaurant, combines the two themes). A picture of the Jewish attorneys of a Century City law firm smacks of ghettoization and one of a woman immersing herself in a Brooklyn ritual bath is intrusive.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UjvUE2HDL.jpg,,,"B001KKBALC,0231108419",,,2208619,,,,,,,The Jews in America

000215854X,,Books,"Fifth in the series that includes the best-selling Italy the Beautiful (Knapp, 1988) and France the Beautiful ( LJ 10/15/89), this big picture book features traditional recipes from around the country, very brief introductions to the various regions, and lots of color photographs. Recipes--grouped by courses of a meal rather than region--give little sense of regional identity; most are familiar and available elsewhere; the blown-up food photographs are more interesting than the postcard views of the country.

0002175800,,Books,"On June 7, 1985, 100 photographers from around the world set out to cover Japan. Many had participated in A Day in the Life of Canada ( LJ 11/1/85) and the similar books on Australia and Hawaii. This, however, is the first such coverage of a non-Western, non-English-speaking country. The color photographs are sumptuously reproduced and every one holds our attention. The pictures are arranged chronologically, from early morning until late at night. A map of Japan shows where each was taken. Photographers are credited next to their pictures, and biographies of participants follow the picture essay, as does a story about their experiences taking these 300 pictures, chosen from some 135,000 exposures. The range of subjects covered is enormous and shakes up our notions about Japan. Highly recommended.

By becoming unhappily entrapped in a railroad tunnel during an air raid, and then by moving carefully across hundreds of miles of French countryside behind German lines all the way to Calais. There, this lonesome British tank finally emerges to blow up a Nazi ammunition dump and its full complement of Panzers. Barrett adeptly represents the English, Canadian and Anglicized French and German accents of the all-male military cast of characters. His skillful reading heightens the tension of this World War II thriller and keeps the listener anxious to hear what happens next, rooting for Bert throughout the tale.  J.D.N.

The photographs contrast modern and traditional life: the Iberia Airlines shuttle between Madrid and Barcelona that carries 3000 passengers a day; farm laborers and fishermen; topless sunbathers; a punk-rocker; men playing dominoes; the stock exchange; produce markets and coal miners; steelworkers and gypsy children; an assembly line and a subway-turnstile jumper; a bullfighting school and a flamenco dancer; windmills turned into weekend homes. Among the 275 color and black-and-white photographs, some images are brilliantly artistic, others amusing, moody, throbbing with hustle, charming or solemn, providing a lively close-up of a day in the life of this Iberian land.

Coming to the throne at the age of five, he ruled for 72 years and presided over the finest flourishing of French culture and one of its greatest periods of expansionist and military glory. This biography uses contemporary sources to examine the sort of monarch Louis XIV really was. The book provides an overview of the entire civilization inspired by and reflecting the glory of the Sun King and so, while the character of Louis himself remains in the foreground, artists like Racine, Moliere, Lully and Mansart (the architect of Versailles) share the middle-ground with politicians such as Cardinal Mazarin and courtiers such as the King?s mistress, Louise de la Valliere. Vincent Cronin?s gracefully written biography of Le Roi Soleil, founded on Cronin?s deep knowledge of this period of French history, provides an illuminating portrait of the king and his court.--This text refers to an alternatePaperbackedition.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51zaDHgUoBL._SL500_.jpg,7.58,,"0006375219,0393007537,0531151123,0415358167,0465004822,0786713097,1590174917,0312261969",,"0140239677,B00FIAWZ5U",2873426,,,,,,,Louis XIV

The last two-thirds of the book contains projects describing how to make curtains, draperies, cushions, tablecloths, and the like. The instructions are sparsely illustrated, but experienced sewers will find this an excellent source of inspiration, especially when viewing the lavish styles depicted in the photographs. Bawden (Rag Rug Inspirations, LJ 2/15/97) depicts a casual, contemporary style of soft furnishings with over 50 projects for curtains, bedcovers, cushions, and lampshades, to name a few, all without sewing a stitch. The instructions are so clearly explained and illustrated that an amateur should have no trouble following them.

Riding her bicycle wherever possible, she traveled  through Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan. Her final destination, Jerusalem,  was a city she knew and loved, so much so that the political turmoil of  recent years had made her unwilling to return.Now, spurred on by the  Jordan/Israel peace treaty and an audience with King Hussein, Bettina  felt that at last perhaps a new perspective on Israel could be  achieved. Over the next two months she traveled widely, from the ruins  of Bybios in Lebanon to the Armenian Cathedral Church in Jerusalem to  the refugee camps of Gaza. In every place she was offered the hand of  friendship by people of diverse race and culture.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414X57VBSGL.jpg,,,,,,8641735,,,,,,,Like Water in a Dry Land: Journey into Modern Israel

0006281052,,Books,"This book by the author of Why Am I Afraid to Love? contains insights on self-awareness, personal growth and communication with others.  Why do people continually hide their real selves from the people around them? Why are so many so insecure and afraid to open up? The answer, explains John Powell, is that maturity is reached by communicating and interacting with others. This book considers the consequences our real self faces if no one else ever finds out what we are like.  In this enduring classic, the companion to Why Am I Afraid to Love?, John Powell explains how to be more emotionally open, and shows how people adopt roles and play psychological games to protect their inner selves. The courage to be our real selves can be developed, and then we can begin to grow.  Now newly designed for a fresh audience, Why Am I Afraid to Tell You Who I Am? is as relevant as it has been for twenty years. With a proven track record, it continues to speak to the needs and aspirations of people today. It is best included in self help sections of general bookshops, but also has a religious appeal.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31uqqYwoYbL.jpg,8.96,"0451165225,0883473224,1559242833,0883473240,0883473216,0883472996,0895050293,0553348000,091359203X,0883473003,0883473437,0894864025,0553268147,157324466X,0892560029,0913592471,0913592617,0671762273,0894866370,1558744274,0894865838,1592854702,156838985X,1439102147,006091646X,1573242136,0883474255,0883473283,1573245488,067162248X,0743243153,1568389809,159285849X,0866834605,0875161561,1570252246,1439102163,0870290010,1568381417,1419381229,0446303380,0910034796,1616495332,006074104X,0671400525,1568385587,1568387989,0894867555,0062505890,0310201071,1594481881,1592407331,0310247454,0895051834,1118076737,0060095806,0896939383,0062506048,1592403352,1556202822,0071385649,0310606314,0061122432,1592851614,0061129739,0671640755,0442241933,0310225590,1608827607,1592854869,0345487427,0471785385,0553266462,1558741127,1573243140,0785263772,0916682579,0553263900,0910034311,0932194176,1592857337,0440506255,0684848066,0688094554,0061777129,0757303234,0553371320,0898621283,068484723X,1572242094,0915811928,1604078510,1878424319,0465016901,0310494818,0060507225,0060081589,1401903479",,,"1559242833,0451165225,0883473240,0883473224",117594,,,,,,,Why Am I Afraid to Tell You Who I Am?

0006281125,,Books,"Celtic spirituality was not the only form of early Christianity in the British Isles.  In fact, a larger number of original texts from the Anglo-Saxons remain today.  This rich vein of simple, but moving, prose and poetry is explored in Anglo-Saxon Christianity.  The key figures of Bebe, Cuthbert and others are introduced alongside new translations of classic texts taken from Beowulf and Old English poetry.  For all who appreciate Celtic spirituality, here is a fresh and alternative source of nourishment and inspiration.  For those looking for an authentic Christian faith Anglo-Saxon Christianity reaches back into the very birth of the English people.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51mDMsbmLmL.jpg,10.79,"0521398193,0809139502,0271007699",,0521398193,"0809139502,0271007699",1397538,,,,,,,Anglo-Saxon Christianity

Based on the only complete set of decrypts held in Britain outside Whitehall, and supplemented by interviews with most of the key players in the drama,VENONAreveals how the U.S. National Security Agency and its British counterpart, GCHQ, spent 37 years analyzing cipher traffic to and from Moscow.

No. 4 Commando&#8217;s training and preparation for their part in the raid was an excellent example of operational planning, and its leadership was superb.

Drawing not only from the Bible, but also from contemporary fiction, film and theatre, he explores the ways society continues to put Christ on trial today. In fact, all Christians stand with him before a watching world.How we respond to this challenge is the focus of Christ on Trial.

I was a prisoner of war, lying among the dead, waiting for the bodies to be carried away so that I might have more room.&#x92; When Ernest Gordon was twenty-four he was captured by the Japanese and forced, with other British prisoners, to build the notorious &#x91;Railroad of Death&#x92;, where nearly 16,000 Prisoners of War gave their life.

And Jesus Will Be Born is a holiday cornucopia filled with the laughter, tears, family foibles, simple joys and the rich blessings of the season.There&#x92;s no predicting what the turn of a page will bring in this Christmas collection by Adrian Plass. It may be a bit of verse to moisten the eyes ...When I&#x92;m in heaven Tell me there&#x92;ll be Christmases without the pain No memories that will not fade No chilled and sullen sense of loss That cannot face the festive flame Nor breathe excitement from the ice-cream air Tell me how the things that Christmas should have been Will be there for eternity in one long shining dawn For all of us to share I love the promises of Christmas.Then again, there is this &#x96; an &#x91;advertisement&#x92; from Plass&#x92;s spoof of a church newsletter:&#x91;How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news? The answer is &#x96; not very, if they haven&#x92;t had those ugly corns treated. Christian chiropodist. Special Yuletide reductions &#x85;&#x92;Setting the poignant, the madcap, the joyous and the tender in artful counterpoint, this is a book to be savoured over the entire holiday season. It offers something for everyone in every setting &#x96; family readings, personal libraries and even church pulpits.And Jesus Will Be Born speaks to the full spectrum of our humanity, celebrating the golden Christmas traditions, poking playfully at our seasonal foibles, observing our less-than-noble attitudes with an eye that is at once honest and gracious &#x96; and always looking towards the Person around whom all that is truly Christmas revolves.In the midst of our festivities, Adrian Plass gently reminds us why we need a Saviour. And he points us towards the unfathomable possibilities that have been opened to us, and the joy and hope that are ours, because Jesus was born long ago in Bethlehem and is born today in us.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SPmF45KJL.jpg,,,,,,3658622,,,,,,,"And Jesus Will Be Born: A Collection of Christmas Poems, Stories and Reflections"

Just as his flashlight grows dim, a spaceship crashes, and a Martian climbs out. Initially, each fears the other, but they quickly become fast friends. Soon they&#x2019;re carrying out a splendid plan to repair their spacecraft and get back to their homes. Children who know Jeffers&#x2019; Lost and Found (2006) and How to Catch a Star (2004) may recognize the distinctive figure of the boy, with his large head, sticklike legs, and striped shirt, and catch other visual references to the earlier books. Economy of line in both text and pictures combine with Jeffers&#x2019; flair for storytelling to create plenty of fine, original scenes. The deadpan text is well matched by the slightly quirky pencil-and-watercolor illustrations, which make great use of color and composition on the large, double-page spreads.

000724794X,,Books,"Starred Review.PreSchool-Grade 3&mdash;Henry loves books. In fact, he literally devours them. And the more he eats, the smarter he gets. When he starts eating too many too fast, he can no longer digest them, and their contents get all mixed up. The simple cartoon illustrations twinkle with humor and feeling. Done in paint and pencil on smart backdrops&mdash;pages from old books&mdash;the pictures set the stage for the quirky story. When forced to give up eating his favorite volumes, Henry eventually learns to enjoy reading them. However, an actual bite taken out of the back cover suggests he still succumbs to the occasional indulgence. This well-done package will charm its audience. The snappy text works well for reading aloud, but older children will enjoy exploring the subtle details hidden in the illustrations and backgrounds.&mdash;Julie Roach, Cambridge Public Library, MACopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

0007254008,,Books,"Compelling characters compensate for a lackluster plot in L&#xE4;ckberg&#x2019;s latest thriller set in the remote Swedish village of Fjallbacka. This time around, veteran detective Patrik Hedstr&#xF6;m investigates a fatal crash involving a local shop owner. Hedstr&#xF6;m fears foul play when he learns that the victim, a teetotaler, had an astonishingly high blood-alcohol level.Turns out, a few unsolved cases over the years had similar circumstances, and Hedstr&#xF6;m considers the possibility that they are all connected. Adding to the detective&#x2019;s woes is an obnoxious reality show (is there any other kind?) that has descended upon Fjallbacka. Ratings climb through the roof when one of the &#x201C;surgically enhanced&#x201D; contestants, nicknamed Barbie, is killed. Could there be a murderer among the cast or crew? Meanwhile, Hedstr&#xF6;m welcomes a new member to the police force, smart and comely Hanna Kruse, whose psychiatrist husband has the unsavory assignment of counseling the reality-show recruits. Fans of L&#xE4;ckberg (The Stonecutter, 2012), who ranks among Sweden&#x2019;s most popular authors, should enjoy the eclectic collection of personalities in this latest offering. --Allison Block--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WUEQ2dqtL.jpg,11.95,"0007419503,0007419538,1451621868,0007419570,1605985538,1451621744,1451621779,0007507496,0007473214,1605983306,1451621795,0804170649,0007253990,B006CDD1VO,0385351372,0345807154,1250022061,0525954023,0142196835,0307960498,034580709X,0452297907,0670026328,1451621760,0007419597,1400031516,1439198926,0525954015,1605980927,1400095824,0385340788,1476724024,0307742989,1402787162,1447217330,1400095832,1611090997,0062271601,0802122647,0312428588,1590516672,1611091012,1616950102,0307951154,0385340796,0307477401,1616952083,0547738757,1400031559,1250043999,0142180815,1400069491,0007419554,0544273397,1250029406,0385341016,0307744639,0316122556,0804178747,0142181315,0525952896,0062237187,0099554976,1569474532,1250037743,0307743187,0312426380,0525953493,1400031575,0425264602,0544002180,1400031540,0547577524,1451608527,006232005X,1477823123,0307951162,0312655479,0425260453,0525953884,0345802527,1616952989,0316224553,1905207670,0062004808,0312536925,1400031567,1611090970,0307960471,081299289X,0684803860,1250000394,1250028582,0062068423,0307472841,030745469X,0525954007",,,"0007419570,1605985538,1451621868,1451621744",419244,,,,,,,The Gallows Bird

After their teacher announces a knowledge-bowl competition, they are determined to beat school meanies Emma and Emily (the &#x201C;M&amp;Ms&#x201D;), and they just might, with new brainiac Rosie on their team. But the M&amp;Ms will do anything to win, even steal the Sleepover Club&#x2019;s bear mascot. The ensuing teddy rescue brings unexpected snafus and escalating rivalry, culminating in a suspenseful game, some sweet revenge, and, best of all, a new Sleepover Club member. First published in Great Britain, this series&#x2019; debut title introduces a lively cast, and Frankie&#x2019;s peppy, often-humorous narrative, which includes some Briticisms that are defined in context, provides an entertaining read even as it highlights the challenges and rewards of friendship. Readers will enjoy following the diverse group&#x2019;s escapades and will look forward to future installments. Instructions for making club member cards and snack-dip recipes are appended.

His setting career started at an equally early age, when he submitted puzzles to the Evening News, who offered two guineas for each successful puzzle. His business career, as a financial controller and director of several BP subsidiary companies, allowed little time for more setting until 1991 when Tim joined The Sunday Times team. He now sets crosswords for the Mephisto and Owzat puzzles in various newspapers. In addition, he was the joint winner in the Observer&#x2019;s monthly Azed clue-writing competitions for 2004/5. Tim also runs crossword workshops for beginners and, as the Cluru (the Clue Guru), provides help for puzzled puzzlers for the Crossword Club.When not puzzling or solving crosswords, Tim Moorey is an after-dinner speaker.

0007285248,,Books,"In this historically accurate debut, Stack vividly recreates the Roman Republic and its first attempts at a Roman navy. Capt. Atticus Perennis is a Roman of Greek ancestry and master of the trireme Aquila. Septimus Capito is one of the first marine Centurions. The two brothers-in-arms must confront both the vagaries of the Senate, with its backstabbing, self-aggrandizing politics, and the difficulties of developing the concept of naval warfare. Characteriza-tion tends to take a backseat to the abundant historical data, as Stack fills his stirring story brimming with the minutiae of Roman military life circa 200 B.C. and the strategic details of conducting battles at sea from slave-powered galleys, but fans of historical naval fiction will be thrilled by this exploration of an oft-ignored era.(July)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

0007285973,,Books,"*Starred Review* Sorting through her parents&#x2019; possessions after their deaths, Mair Ellis discovers a Kashmir shawl that once belonged to her Welsh grandmother, Nerys Watkins. Nestled within the folds of this exquisite handwoven piece is an envelope containing a single lock of hair. Curiosity drives Mair to trace the history of the shawl, a quest that takes her from Wales to India. As she pieces together her grandmother&#x2019;s past, the two women&#x2019;s stories intertwine, transporting the reader between the Kashmir of WWII and the present day. The bulk of the novel belongs to Nerys, a missionary&#x2019;s wife whose undemonstrative husband urges her to spend the winter in Srinigar with a friend while he spreads Christianity in remote settlements. Nerys is forever changed in this romantic city, blossoming in an illicit affair while being swept up in the dangerous unraveling of another&#x2019;s. The consequences resurface nearly seven decades later, leaving Mair with a life-altering decision. An avid traveler and thorough researcher, Thomas brings the flavors and colors of India to life with vivid detail and develops characters so real one feels a kinship. An engrossing, intelligent, and satisfying read, this publication is the American debut of a UK best-seller. --Diane Holcomb--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/912HNTmZV6L.jpg,11.95,"1451655827,0062188518,0143125435,1476703558,1594486433,0007173547,0007285949,1451655789,055359253X,1468308785,1476703574,0007173520,0062273450,0767919378,0307590445,1571746854,1847391400,0061950726,1250031613,1849832889,1476746583,037597136X,0805094490,1451681755,0451465822,0451419480,1605985724,1451606346,1849835314,1496190459,0758292759,1439152810,0451240464,0758278454,0099464861,0670024783,0316055433,1611099285,140913590X,0399157980,0143126474,0758285752,0062237195,161218426X,1612183328,1402293313,0345528689,0749040262,0452298393,1552782492,0143123920,0062234463,1616203218,0061710245,0062257846,1590516400,0451416635,1477807675,1451672799,0307950433,0988940833,0062077309,0316176494,140227663X,0452298385,0749009012,1451698984,0399162178,1594632294,0778316211,0062310771,1402258615,0345525558,0425261263,0062077880,0062229311,1496147111,1611173914,0099464837,1439101124,0062300377,1250027861,1439153663,1611458315,0143124544,0758278438,0062065254,1451623496,0142196991,0991097505,1476743509,1400069491,1250040779,0143121103,0778314391,0345527275,1476709017,0452297648,1472212746,0142180548",,,"0062188518,1476703558,1476746583,0767919378",708219,,,,,,,Kashmir Shawl

0007304005,,Books,"*Starred Review* Iggulden follows the breakaway success of his nonfiction guide to restoring adventure to overprotected kids (The Dangerous Book for Boys, 2007) with another wickedly funny and ingenious read. This time, he creates an intricate fictional world in which the tiny Sparkler&#x2014;Peter Pan&#x2013;like in his mischief, Ulysses-esque in his cunning&#x2014;holds together three separate stories. Tollins are tiny, nectar-eating woodland creatures with elf ears and wings but bigger than the fairies they casually use as handkerchiefs. They enjoy an idyllic existence until a fireworks factory is built in the village of Chorleywood. One of the Tollins falls into a rocket, producing the most bang for the buck ever witnessed, and the men of the village hunt the Tollins down to use as fodder for their fireworks. Parts 2 and 3 continue Sparkler&#x2019;s perils and escapes from prison, execution, and a runaway hot-air balloon. Sparkler is a self-made scientist&#x2014;it&#x2019;s great fun to see him using applied chemistry for fireworks, finding herbs for medicine, and discovering the first steam engine. Duncan&#x2019;s full-color illustrations and maps bring the world to witty life. A note at the end likens the Tollins&#x2019; fate to child labor during the Industrial Revolution. There is much to think about and love in this beautifully realized world.

000734421X,,Books,"*Starred Review* MacBride&#x2019;s seventh Logan McRae novel may be the most harrowing yet&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s saying something. The Aberdeen, Scotland, police detective finds himself working two kidnapping cases that couldn&#x2019;t be more different. In the first, a mother-daughter singing duo, made famous on the TV show Britain&#x2019;s Next Big Star, is being held for ransom with the little girl&#x2019;s toes offered up as proof of their abductors&#x2019; seriousness. In the other, a junkie has gone missing, presumably due to her boyfriend&#x2019;s role in a drug deal. If Dark Blood (2011) suffered from slackness, then this installment finds MacBride roaring back to form. The crimes are breathtakingly awful, the pacing is breakneck, and the stakes are higher than ever. Indeed, when fallout from his actions lands close to home, McRae finds himself wracked by guilt far worse than his many physical wounds. Few writers can blend bantering humor with gut-wrenching violence without it feeling cheap. MacBride entertains while still offering food for thought about what we consume as entertainment: Why does the public weep for one missing mother, who may be a fame-hungry monster, while not caring about another, who may be a victim of circumstances? There&#x2019;s little comfort in this bleak ending, but still: brilliant. Bloody. Brilliant. --Keir Graff--This text refers to thePaperbackedition.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CVjuH7XSL.jpg,3.79,"0007362544,0007344260,B005EP2XSS,0007344171,0007193157,0312339992,0007244606,0312382634,031233995X,0316224588,0007344201,0312949359,0312940599,0802120253,0007342578,0007419465,0091935997,1842999575,0751545643,0751543799,0312570813,0399158642,B00F6J1RZC,1616950064,1932859446,0330509497,1250048834,0751542911,072786842X,1250006600,B00C01GBL4,0751543845,0758287917,B00E8V9YN6,1605983780,0330460862,0141044349,031255804X,1616951745,0802120520",,,"0007344295,0312382634,0007419465,0007419449",1350069,,,,,,,Shatter the Bones

The virus left her paralysed below the waist and she spent the next twenty-eight years struggling to get around on callipers and crutches (wheelchairs are not widely available in Kenya). She graduated from university with a degree in education and then met her husband-to-be, Norman, a British man teaching in Kenya. They married and settled in the UK and now have a son together. In 2004 Anne represented Kenya in the Paralympics. In 2012 she will be representing Great Britain.

His girlfriend, Samantha, is still in the hospital, and his grip on reality is slipping (&#x201C;Like it or not, you&#x2019;re still alive&#x201D; is the reminder taped to his mirror)&#x2014;good thing there&#x2019;s plenty of crime to keep his mind off things. A high-profile movie is being filmed on his Aberdeen, Scotland, beat, and someone is reenacting occult scenes from the hit novel it&#x2019;s based on, right down to the bleeding, burning, and hanging of suspected witches. Someone else is battering Asian men, who refuse to identify a culprit. And the aging Wee Hamish is still trying to bestow his criminal empire on McRae, earning the police detective unwelcome attention from Reuben, the thug who actually wants to inherit. This eighth series installment delivers everything MacBride&#x2019;s fans have come to expect: knotty plotting, gruesome crime scenes, swinging gallows humor, and some of the most creative cursing in contemporary crime fiction.

0007337914,,Books,"&#x2018;In The Lion Wakes Robert Low has created an enthralling, complete world: profoundly researched, brilliantly imagined. The novel is intensely exciting, enjoyable and satisfying: a novel of honour, duty, chivalry, desperation, self-interest and fear &#x2013; more sophisticated than almost any recent novel with an historical setting.Crackling with original descriptive prose &#x2013; sudden, arresting images combined with dialogue and accents caught to perfection &#x2013; there is something deeply lyrical about its use of language.Robert Low writes too well for this novel to be contained by the label of &#x201C;historical fiction&#x201D; The Lion Wakes deserves to be read by all fans of historical fiction, but also by many, many more &#x2013; by all those who enjoy classic storytelling in wonderful prose&#x2019;Harry Sidebottom&#x2018;An outstanding novel. The Lion Wakes is a fantastic read, written by a real master of historical fiction. Low has painted a most compelling picture of 13th century Scotland. I cannot wait for the next book in the series&#x2019;Ben Kane&#x2018;With excellent characters and an engaging plot that reeks of authenticity, The Lion Wakes is powerful stuff.

0007344201,,Books,"Taking a break from his Logan McRae series, MacBride offers a stand-alone whose premise is pure, twisted genius. Ash Henderson, a big, bruising police detective in fictional Oldcastle, Scotland, has been chasing a killer who snatches girls before their thirteenth birthday, tortures them to death, and then sends birthday cards&#x2014;with gruesome photos&#x2014;to the girls&#x2019; families each year thereafter. The kicker? Henderson has been getting the birthday cards, too, but won&#x2019;t tell anyone his missing daughter is also a victim: if he&#x2019;s taken off the case, he&#x2019;ll lose his chance to catch the &#x201C;Birthday Boy&#x201D; himself. This has all the hallmarks of MacBride&#x2019;s best books&#x2014;gruesome violence, foul weather, pitch-black humor, and entertainingly mismatched protagonists (Henderson is paired with &#x201C;freak-show&#x201D; forensic psychologist Alice McDonald). But despite all this has to offer readers so inclined, MacBride needs an editor who&#x2019;s not afraid to use a knife, as the book feels about 100 pages and one plot twist too long. On the other hand, those who enjoy spending time in MacBride&#x2019;s dark world may not mind a bit. --Keir Graff",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XuXImjT1L.jpg,3.79,"0007344244,0007362544,0007419465,0007344295,B005IV0BHS,0007344260,0007419457,0007342578,0007419422,0007560486,0007419449,0007344309,0312940599,0312949359,B005EP2XSS,0312382634,0802122485,1616148772,0062004808,0316224553,0525954015,1616147164,1616147873,0802122132,0062219464,0544319486,0345533763,0307960498,0062240501,0857382225,0345807154,034580709X,0061986488,0399162380,031233995X,0670026328,1250036135,0399162372,0143123769,0385351372,1623650003,1476744483,031622460X,0061990620,1405913185,1842999575,0525952969,0312359675,0316188522,1605985104,1476724024,0385348452,1455517135,0061990639,0330546015,1609450922,0316224588,0751545643,0802122507,0802121071,0802145175,0399165525,B00969PYQ6,0062271601,1616950102,0544319494,0143119494,0802146120,0399166432,0802122043,1590200276,0670026468,0316188514,0727883313,0316069345,0062227378,0804170649,0802126073,0802145566,0525954007,0312643217,0743289242,0345547497,0142196835,0547792778,0312384424,0312614586,0316069515,0547738757,0330518712,0062237187,000734421X,1611090997,006052524X,1250007585,039915972X,161695230X,1454901276,0802121489,1455504734",,"0007344244,0007362544","0007419457,0007419449,0007419465,0312382634",422317,,,,,,,Birthdays for the Dead

0007373619,,Books,"Kelly&#x2019;s latest novel features four women&#x2014;all beautiful, all wounded in one way or another, and all facing life crises at the same time. Sisters Suki and Tess hail from an Irish town where the postmistress, Danae (a woman of mystery to curious townsfolk), is joined by her heartbroken niece, Mara&#x2014;romances ensue. Stories with four main characters are bound to be complex, and this one is no exception, but plots and subplots are well handled. Secondary characters are quirky and add to the reading fun. The omniscient narration covers 20 years in the lives of the women through flashbacks, artfully placed to shed a little light on present-day happenings and just enough information to ensure a suspenseful read. Kelly&#x2019;s readers will take comfort in her recognition of the humor in daily life, the necessity of friendship to women, and the strength of bonds among families. This modern-day fairy tale, which starts out sad and ends up just fine, will please Kelly&#x2019;s fans and appeal to more mature readers of chick lit. --Ellen Loughran--This text refers to thePaperbackedition.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uPgI7Y%2BhL.jpg,10.38,"0007240449,0747260583,0385351852,B006CDEK6E,1853717967,0007156332,0143118498,0452283388,1451616767,1416564608,B001P5HD54,B001PO69G4,B001PO69GO,0007466935,1402260113,0747260575,0755343875,0755333861,1444706829,0857208969,0007488238,0330520539,1782921966,0007373678,0755378407,B003E7EW1O,184983203X,B0058M5CLM,0241950589,0060731486,0755378431,B00CY3B8GQ,1402284403,1402218338,0593071514,000743734X,0752847953,1844880699,1250046343,0755332520,075289336X,0752883496,184744458X,0752883526,1409135470,1476704511,0340766891,1782921982,1849164185",,,"0007373678,B005Q6ECLG,B001PO69G4,1476704511",1738736,,,,,,,House on Willow Street

000741949X,,Books,"Long troubled by her late mother&#x2019;s coldness toward her two daughters, writer Erica Falck begins to read her mother, Elsy&#x2019;s, teenage diaries. She also discovers a Nazi war medal with the diaries and asks a retired history teacher to examine it. Within days, the teacher is bludgeoned to death. Then Britta, Elsy&#x2019;s closest friend as a teenager, who is suffering from Alzheimer&#x2019;s, is also murdered. Through the diaries, Erica intuits that the solution to the mystery is rooted in events that took place during WWII. Once again, L&#xE4;ckberg (The Stonecutter, 2012) employs Swedish history and her setting, Fjallbacka, the postcard-pretty village where Falck grew up, to craft an engaging tale that spans three generations of Fjallbackians. The author goes deep into the lives of a very large cast of characters, and some crime lovers might balk at a 520-plus&#x2013;page novel that is almost half family saga. But taken as a whole, The Hidden Child will keep fans of Swedish crime guessing until the final pages. --Thomas Gaughan--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pgaeFe-8L.jpg,12.99,"0007419538,0007419570,0007253990,1605984256,1451621868,0007473214,1605985546,1451621779,1451621795,1451621744,0007507496,1605983306,0007419597,B006CDD1VO,0385340788,1451621760,0385340796,0385341016,1402787162,0345807154,1616951117,1611091012,0525954023,0007419554,0525954015,144721658X,1611090997,0312605048,1611090970,1439198918,143919890X,0141399996,0525954007,1605980927,0547738757,1250029406,1444721623,0307960498,0330512595,0061143391,0385351372,1846557119,0452297907,0552160954,1569474532,0374298661,0670026328,0544273397,0552160938,0061143375,0804170649,1447217330,1451608527,1471115178,1569474893,0312641745,1616952989,1616952083,1468301454,0857051733,0156031361,1477823123,0312427328,0156034042,1250024102,034580709X,1849835136,0241956447,0142196835,0156030497,1905207670,0312655304,1847375707,0312428065,1250000394,0857521403,1616950102,1846555396,B006W4006M,1451634781,1250007585,0312428588,0385342225,1908737492,1250045622,0156032120,0312610599,1904738923,0062297600,1476734003,0143112430,0525952896,1616953047,1444734423,1623651697,145160694X,0307387224,1616950080,1612184375",,,"0007419570,1451621744,0007419538,B006CDD1VO",527540,,,,,,,The Hidden Child (Patrick Hedstrom and Erica Falck)

0007437315,,Books,"From Booklist -Starred Review Huffington argues that overspending on war at the expense of domestic issues and the alarming decline of the middle class are troubling signals that the US is losing its economic, political, and social stability... She pinpoints the beginning of the decline to the Reagan era, with its denigration of a government safety net. But she is nonpartisan in assigning responsibility to George W. Bush and Bill Clinton for supporting monied interests over those of the middle class; she then takes aim at Obama for expending more money to bail out Wall Street than Main Street. She also points to loss of manufacturing jobs, outsourcing, and globalization, all with emphasis on corporate profits at the expense of workers. Although the US has faced similarly fearful times during the late 1800s and the Great Depression, the middle class was not threatened as it is today...An engaging analysis of troubling economic and political trends. An alarming account - Joseph Stiglitz A voice of conscience in a time when we need conscience more than ever. - Elizabeth Warren, Harvard Law School professor and author of The Two-Income Trap In precise, graphic, and shocking terms that will bring the crisis home to everyone...Huffington explains why special interests have become too powerful, money dominates our politics, and there is no sense of empathy or even shame amongst our elite.

0007441290,,Books,"Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2011:Even among authors,Jeffrey Eugenidespossesses a rare talent for being able to inhabit his characters. InThe Marriage Plot, his third novel and first in ten years (following the Pulitzer Prize-winningMiddlesex), Eugenides describes a year or so in the lives of three college seniors at Brown in the early 80s. There is Madeleine, a self-described &#x201C;incurable romantic&#x201D; who is slightly embarrassed at being so normal. There is Leonard, a brilliant, temperamental student from the Pacific Northwest. And completing the triangle is Mitchell, a Religious Studies major from Eugenides&#x2019; own Detroit. What follows is a book delivered in sincere and genuine prose, tracing the end of the students&#x2019; college days and continuing into those first, tentative steps toward true adulthood. This is a thoughtful and at times disarming novel about life, love, and discovery, set during a time when so much of life seems filled with deep portent.--Chris Schluep--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/8133T6vzrSL.jpg,7.99,"0374199698,0312428812,0316126691,0307957128,0312427735,0307592839,0385343833,0062049801,0374158460,0307263991,1451664125,0307267679,030758836X,1594488398,B00FY58ZNA,0374129983,1594203970,0316055433,0374284385,0679432477,0345521307,0316126675,1594487367,0307477479,0307947726,0385535775,1594200637,0307276686,0061493341,0307593312,B001QFZLOS,1608195228,0062065246,1400063736,1594489580,0061579033,0679410325,1582345082,0307599469,0307408841,B005DIAMDE,0812993802,0670022691,0679432469,1400065453,0307958701,0316176486,1400066409,0385536828,0312576463,0316175676,B00B9ZEJO8,0914671006,0307265749,0385343841,1400068096,0062060554,140006872X,1401340873,0374299102,0679644199,0805090037,B00CC6F7SA,1400031702,1400067553,1439142009,0770437850,0929701836,0061692042,140006208X,0061928127,0307592731,1400067685,0865479437,0812992792,B00B1L8XL0,0374266328,0812993217,0374281149,0316074330,0374532311,0062124269,0316777722,0143117955,0307272761,B0006Q1UKW,038553504X,0679450041,0374214913,0670026638,0312421273,0385351399,0307742172,0307700003,034552554X,0812982622,039333919X,0375708464,0385475721",,,"0312427735,0312428812,0316055433,0307588378",4167878,,,,,,,The Marriage Plot

0007438516,,Books,"June Thomson was born in Ayrshire. Growing up in a broken home left her with a legacy of loneliness and isolation. When she met and married Rab Thomson she mistook his jealousy for love. She soon learned it was a need to control her. June endured 27 years with a man who beat and raped her. When she finally found the courage to leave, Rab took a hellish revenge.Giselle Ross was born in Glasgow into a home so loving that she did not leave until she was 32 years old. She was swept off her feet by devious charmer Ashok Kalyanjee. He persuaded her to elope and then quickly isolated her from her family. The relationship was doomed before it began, but when Giselle broke free, there was an appalling price to pay.Marion Scott and Jim McBeth are a husband and wife team, helping June and Giselle to tell their story. Marion is an award-winning journalist with Scotland&#x2019;s biggest newspaper, The Sunday Mail. As well as winning accolades for her campaigning work on child abuse issues and miscarriages of justice, she has won the Campaigning Journalist of the Year award. Jim has been writing for national newspapers for 43 years. He currently works for the Daily Mail. He has also contributed to a number of national television and BBC radio documentaries.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QxGsFJMdL.jpg,1.99,"1250009715,0425258734,0786032464,0312945086,0786032553,0786032537,0425250342,0786031522,0425258823,0425258769,0985972831,0786032448,1484140001,0786032774,0062018558,149368969X,1416544623,0425250512,1940363101,031253972X,0786020385,0985247843,1934602167,0786024879,1250010357,1479749818,0786024860,0425237788,0425244881,0786027614,0615833411,0007256817,0786029250,0786032502,0786026863,1250027144,0425239152,1451648294,1934602310,0988928310,0312948468,1480023647,1451648286,1250006155,0786027940,0825307279,1466283289,078603419X,0425243664,0312929293,1625104944,0312594356,098579982X,0988563908,1617734454,0312995288,0425263657,0380780410,0989467511,0786018518,1497359007,078601783X,0425234657,0061230871,0446505293,006087824X,1625104219,0425250474,0312946996,0312948123,0786034157,0425263649,0786024852,0312373090,0061582026,031238176X,1451674775,0786021322,0786029269,0425244288,0312985258,1482594145,0312540825,0312982143,0553381970,0786020466,0312365179,1250049458,0062218832,1489502793,0312977646,1250003539,1476715637,0786022183,0061582018,0440204429,0007436602,1558177299,0312530897,0786019514",,"0425258734,0312945086","1250009715,0425258734,0786032537,0786032464",547059,,,,,,,"Beyond All Evil: Two monsters, two mothers, a love that will last forever"

0007410956,,Books,"Amazon Best Books of the Month, May 2011:  Near the end of World War II, a plane carrying 24 members of the United States military, including nine Women&#x2019;s Army Corps (WAC) members, crashed into the New Guinea jungle during a sightseeing excursion. 21 men and women were killed. The three survivors--a beautiful WAC, a young lieutenant who lost his twin brother in the crash, and a severely injured sergeant--were stranded deep in a jungle valley notorious for its cannibalistic tribes. They had no food, little water, and no way to contact their military base. The story of their survival and the stunning efforts undertaken to save them are the crux ofLost in Shangri-La, Mitchell Zuckoff&#x2019;s remarkable and inspiring narrative. Faced with the potential brutality of the Dani tribe, known throughout the valley for its violence, the trio&#x2019;s lives were dependent on an unprecedented rescue mission--a dedicated group of paratroopers jumped into the jungle to provide aid and medical care, consequently leaving the survivors and paratroopers alike trapped on the jungle floor. A perilous rescue by plane became their only possible route to freedom. A riveting story of deliverance under the most unlikely circumstances,Lost in Shangri-Ladeserves its place among the great survival stories of World War II.--Lynette MongAmazon Exclusive: Hampton Sides ReviewsLost in Shangri-LaHampton Sidesis the editor-at-large forOutsidemagazine and the author of the international bestsellerGhost Soldiers, which won the 2002 PEN USA Award for nonfiction and the 2002 Discover Award from Barnes &amp; Noble, and also served as the basis for the 2005 Miramax filmThe Great Raid.Although World War II was the greatest conflict in the history of this planet, many a jaded reader has come to the reluctant conclusion that there aren&rsquo;t any more World War II stories left to tell. At least not good ones&mdash;not tales of the &ldquo;ripping good yarn&rdquo; variety. Yet remarkably, in his new bookLost in Shangri-La, Mitchell Zuckoff has found one, and he&rsquo;s told it with reportorial verve, narrative skill, and exquisite pacing.What makes this World War II story all the more fascinating is that it isn&rsquo;t really a war story&mdash;not in a strict military sense. It&rsquo;s more of an exotic adventure tale with rich anthropological shadings. In 1945, near the end of the war, an American plane crashes in a hidden jungle valley in New Guinea inhabited by Stone Age cannibals. 21 Americans die in the crash, but three injured survivors soon find themselves stumbling through the jungle without food, nursing terrible wounds and trying to elude Japanese snipers known to be holding out in the mountains.The first contact between the three Americans and the valley&rsquo;s Dani tribesmen is both poignant and comical. The Americans, Zuckoff writes, have &ldquo;crash-landed in a world that time didn&rsquo;t forget. Time never knew it existed.&rdquo; The tribesmen, who have never encountered metal and have yet to master the concept of the wheel, think the American interlopers are white spirits who&rsquo;ve descended on a vine from heaven, fulfilling an ancient legend. They&rsquo;re puzzled and fascinated by the layers of &ldquo;removable skin&rdquo; in which these alien visitors are wrapped; the natives, who smear their bodies in pig grease and cover their genitals with gourds, have never seen clothes before.The Americans, in turn, are pretty sure their boartusk-bestudded hosts want to skewer them for dinner.What ensues in Zuckoff&rsquo;s fine telling is not so much a cultural collision as a pleasing and sometimes hilarious mutual unraveling of assumptions. Though the differences in the two societies are chasmic, the Americans and the Dani become&mdash;in a guarded, tentative sort of way&mdash;friends.But when armed American airmen arrive via parachute to rescue the survivors, relations become more tense. The Americans make their camp right in the middle of a no-man&rsquo;s land between warring Dani tribes&mdash;a no-man&rsquo;s land where for centuries they have fought the battles that are central to their daily culture. Here, Zuckoff notes, the ironies are profoundly rich. The Dani, untouched by and indeed utterly unaware of the great war that&rsquo;s been raging all across the globe, become thoroughly discombobulated when their own war is temporarily disrupted.Yes, therearestill a few good World War II stories left to tell. And yes, this one meets all the requirements of a ripping good yarn. Zuckoff, who teaches journalism at Boston University, is a first-rate reporter who has spared no expense to rescue this tale from obscurity. His story has it all: Tragedy, survival, comedy, an incredibly dangerous eleventh-hour rescue, and an immensely attractive heroine to boot. It&rsquo;s extraordinary that Hollywood hasn&rsquo;t already taken this tale and run wild with it. If it did, the resulting movie would be equal partsAlive,Cast Away, andThe Gods Must Be Crazy. It&rsquo;s as though the Americans have arrived in the Stone Age through a wormhole in the space-time continuum. The Dani don&rsquo;t know what to do with themselves&mdash;and life, as any of us know it, will never be the same.--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Go8ePXsGL.jpg,3.99,"0062133403,0062133438,0451224957,0451234103,1400078458,1565124081,1602392366,0812968360,0316159352,0425255735,0471423513,1594487278,1402273371,0553381903,0891418458,1599210630,0307453286,0375760989,0425252868,038549565X,0609807161,B0085RZFDC,0141001828,1933718749,0618257322,1400064163,0062116150,0307387941,0545055768,0393345416,030740885X,0671664271,0688016200,078670621X,0804100039,0812974492,0440246040,0307346617,0143125478,0553384503,0553385127,006123625X,0062009303,031624290X,0062116169,140006693X,0307275906,0316501115,0760345910,0062066404,0553381482,0760344078,0760345597,0061650714,0812974611,1599951509,0061950726,0061802557,145167757X,0767910745,0767913736,1423152883,006093638X,0143111973,0307888002,0307389049,0062020897,0380789035,067002581X,0425257835,0375708278,1451640226,0743270754,0812980549,0891419063,0375842209,0345541332,0307476413,0062218298,0385494785,1565129849,0062118854,0316176494,0142001619,0061537969,0767919416,1451617534,1416571779,0871407868,076034518X,039334407X,140009593X,0451419243,0061792268,0670024783,0451232852,0312539568,1250037751,0767929713",,,"0062133403,0451224957,0425255735,1400064163",3848138,,,,,,,Lost in Shangri-La: Escape from a Hidden World
