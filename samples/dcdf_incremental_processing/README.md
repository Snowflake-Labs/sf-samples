# Getting Started with DCDF Data Architecture Incremental Processing & Logical Partitions

## Overview
In this guide, we will focus on the actual SQL code templates for ingesting, transforming and restructuring data into the presentation layer using incremental processing and logical partition definitions.

These scripts were originally covered in the Episode 2 of the Snowflake's Data Cloud Deployment Framework(DCDF) webinar series. [DCDF Webinar Episode 2](https://www.snowflake.com/webinar/for-customers/applying-architectural-patterns-to-solve-business-questions-2023-01-11/) focused on the ELT implementation patterns to operationalize data loading, centralize the management of data transformations and restructure the data for optimal reporting and analysis.
