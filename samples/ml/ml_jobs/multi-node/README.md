# Multi-Node ML Jobs Examples

This directory contains examples of running distributed machine learning workloads across multiple nodes using Snowflake ML Jobs.

Multi-node jobs allow you to:
- Scale your training across multiple compute instances via Ray
- Process larger datasets and train more complex models
- Speed up training through parallelization

## Available Examples

- [XGBoost Distributed Training](./xgb-distributed/): Train an XGBoost model using a distributed setup with multiple nodes.
