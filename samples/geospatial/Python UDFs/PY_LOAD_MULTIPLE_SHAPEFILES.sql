-- === Loading all shape files from .zip using SHAPE_MULTI_FILE ===
-- The GEO file load reader is built as a User Defined Table Function (UDTF)
-- and returns a result set from the the zip archive with shapefiles. Using a UDTF provides
-- the greatest flexibility for loading data, since the user can SELECT only the attributes they need
-- from the file.

-- === Requirements ===
--  - The file must be packaged as a standard zip file
--  - The zipped file must sit on share that the role has access to
--  - Role must have the ability to execute the function
--  - Depending on file and warehouse sizes the STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS will
--    need to be increased. Testing with one of the Ookla files on a medium warehouse,
--    required the timeout to be increased to over 10 minutes.

-- === Parameters ===
--  - ZIP_FILE_NAME - The scoped URL to the zipped file on the Snowflake share and is
--    generated using the build_scoped_file_url function. This function requires two
--    parameters:
--    - Snowflake share of where the file is located
--    - Name of the file, including path

-- === UDTF Code ===
