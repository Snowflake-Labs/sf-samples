# Healthcare Insurance Member 360 Data Setup for Cortex Analyst

You are the Business Leader for a Payer/Health Planâ€™s Call Center operations. There are 4 primary caller personas reaching your Call Center - Member, Provider, Employer and Broker. Based on a detailed study you have identified that Call Center Agents are currently struggling with timely and simplified access to relevant personalized information, and this is degrading the related caller experience.

## Data Setup
This example is from the perspective of the `Member` caller persona, and we have caller specific data e.g. Member 360 data for Members in this scenario.

### Create Snowflake objects
Copy & paste the following in a sql worksheet and run all:

```sql
USE ROLE SYSADMIN;

-- Assign Query Tag to Session. This helps with performance monitoring and troubleshooting.
ALTER SESSION SET query_tag = '{"origin":"sf_sit-is","name":"hcls_payer_cortex_analyst","version":{"major":1, "minor":0},"attributes":{"is_quickstart":0, "source":"sql"}}';

-- Create a new database, schema, and stage
CREATE OR REPLACE WAREHOUSE HCLS_CORTEX_ANALYST_WH;
CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE HCLS_PAYER_MEMBER_DB;
CREATE OR REPLACE SCHEMA HCLS_PAYER_MEMBER_SCHEMA;
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE HCLS_PAYER_MEMBER_STAGE;
