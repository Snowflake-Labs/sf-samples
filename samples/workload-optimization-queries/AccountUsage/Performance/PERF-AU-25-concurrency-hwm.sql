-- NAME:	 PERF-AU-25-concurrency-hwm.txt
-------------------------------------------------
-- DESCRIPTION:
--	Calculates High Water Mark and average HWM for a warehouse
--
-- OUTPUT:
--	Understand HWM and average HWM for a warehouse
--
-- NEXT STEPS:
--	Further analyze concurrency to understand full impact
--	Address throughput (SQL & Cluster Keys)
--	Address throughput (scale up… vWH sizing)
--	Address concurrency (scale out…increase clusters)
