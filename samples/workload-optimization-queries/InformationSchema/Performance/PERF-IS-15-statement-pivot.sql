-- NAME:	 PERF-IS-15-statement-pivot.txt
-------------------------------------------------
-- DESCRIPTION:
--	Statement types by hour, last request is a pivot
--
-- OUTPUT:
--	statement type count by hour
--	statement type count by warehouse by hour
--	pivot statement type counts by warehouse by hour where filtering on statement type
--	look for outliers, high volumes of requests within certain periods
--
-- NEXT STEPS:
--	Narrow timeframe for analysis
--	Identify requests for analysis
--	SQL Optimization
--	Object Optimization
--	Warehouse sizing
