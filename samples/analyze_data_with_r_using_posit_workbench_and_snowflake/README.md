# Analyze Data with R using Posit Workbench and Snowflake

Accompanying repository for the
[Analyze Data with R using Posit Workbench and Snowflake]()
solution in the
[Snowflake Solutions Center](https://developers.snowflake.com/solutions/).

## Overview

This guide will show you how to use the R language to analyze data stored in Snowflake. It will take you through the process of setting up an R environment in an RStudio Pro IDE, which comes with the Posit Workbench Native App in Snowflake. It will also show you how to use R's `{dbplyr}` interface to translate R code into SQL where it can be run within a Snowflake database, which is an environment that provides more memory and compute power than the typical R environment.

We will explore a financial service use case of analyzing web traffic to identify market opportunities.

Here you will find a
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/)
document (`quarto.qmd`) with our web traffic analysis and a
[Shiny interactive dashboard application](https://shiny.posit.co/)
(`app/`).
