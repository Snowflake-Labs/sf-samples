# Agentic Insurance Claim Processor

This is an end-to-end insurance claim processing application built using agentic AI principles. It processes a driverâ€™s license, a claim form, and a car damage photo through a structured workflow. Each step is handled by an intelligent component: document extraction using Snowflake Cortex Document AI, image and text analysis using Claude (via Amazon Bedrock), policy validation using Snowflake queries, and decision email generation using Mistral. The workflow is managed using LangGraph, simulating how a human agent would evaluate and decide on claims.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Upload Documents**:

   * Upload driver's license, claim form, and car image.

2. **Extract Driver's License Data**:

   * Use Snowflake Cortex Document AI for field extraction.

3. **Extract Claim Form Data**:

   * Process the claim form for relevant details.

4. **Analyze Car Image**:

   * Claude performs image analysis to assess car damage.

5. **Cross-Document Comparison**:

   * Compare extracted fields from documents (e.g., full name, vehicle color, VIN) for consistency.

6. **Check Policy Validity**:

   * Validate the policy using the customer ID and the incident date.

7. **Generate Final Decision Email**:

   * Mistral generates a personalized email for the customer, detailing the claim decision.
