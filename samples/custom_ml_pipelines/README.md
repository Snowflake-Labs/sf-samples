### Building ML Pipelines with Scikit-Learn's Custom Transformers

This repo contains the relevant code related to the blog post titled "Custom Preprocessing in ML Pipelines using Snwoflake Model Registry & Scikit-Learn." It contains the following: 

1. taxi_sample.csv: a sample dataset taken from the [NYC taxi trip dataset](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)
2. Notebooks, including `00_SETUP.ipynb` and `01_Custom_Preprocessing_Pipeline.ipynb` which detail how to set up the dataset, and cover the example pipeline code respectively.
