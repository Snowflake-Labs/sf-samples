# Changelog

## Future ToDo:
 - COSTCENTER table exists in each of the Streamlit app schemas, should we centralize it?

## [1.3] - 2025-07-18
 - Map to warehouse_id instead of name in tag_references join in case of name changes and performance.
 - Bug fixes for Streamlit apps not working.
 - Bug fixes for views
 - Readme updates

## [1.2] - 2025-05-20
  - Major update to how cost per query is calculated requiring full redo of SF_CREDITS_BY_QUERY table data and updated schema.
    - Added QUERY_LOAD_PERCENT to tables and use it in calculation to potentially decrement the queries cost based on this percentage.
    e.g. if the value is 25% then the adjustment of warehouse weight for that query is multiplied by 25%
  - Updated linear forecast view to handle multi-year contract periods.
