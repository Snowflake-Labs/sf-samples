## Snowflake Samples

This repository contains a collection of Snowflake sample code. Some samples are SQL snippets, some are sample datasets, others are python applications using snowpark - anything is fair game to be a Snowflake sample! Browse the `samples` directory for a complete listing of all samples and checkout the readme file for each to learn more about each sample.

All subdirectories here contain the downloadable files and datasets needed for tutorials found on quickstarts.snowflake.com

## Contributing

Anyone can add new samples! Follow the [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) to add your sample today!

All new samples should be created in a new directory inside `samples` with your complete source code. Be sure to include a readme.md file inside your newly created directory so users know how to use your sample code in their own projects.
